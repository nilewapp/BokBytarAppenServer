## TODO

### Database services

The following features need to be implemented in the database with associated 
API as webservices, accessible by the app.

#### Groups

Users of the app should be able to create "groups" relevant to specific subjects,
university programmes, courses, lectures, group projects, etc..

#### Asking questions

Users should be able to ask questions to groups and other members of the groups
should be able to answer these questions. They should be able to up-vote answers
that they think are helpful and down-vote unhelpful answers.

#### Discussions

Users should be able to create discussion threads within groups.
